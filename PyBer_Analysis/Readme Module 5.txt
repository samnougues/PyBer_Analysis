#  A written report for the PyBer analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis aims to glean valuable information from data on ride-sharing and city types.

## Results:

According to the line chart and table, the highest demand for ride-sharing services is in urban city types. That is followed by the demand in suburban city types, and the lowest demand for ride-sharing services is in rural areas. This makes sense because the highest population of individuals lives in urban city types, and that rate of population drops in suburban places. And it even drops further in rural areas. The average fare per rider is lower in urban places because higher competition lowers costs. 

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

My advice is as follows:
	1) The CEO could leave the disparities alone. The disparities exist because the market has determined these prices due to supply and demand.
	2) If the CEO wants to change it, they can offer incentives to drivers in rural areas, a bonus for working a certain amount of rides.
	3) The CEO could pay those in the urban areas less, so they would want to work in the rural areas.
